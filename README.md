# letter

I always wanted a really simple tool to create single-page letters without using Word, Pages or even Indesign. It's a rough draft so far, but looks quite promising. It's super easy to customize via CSS and already produces usable print results in Chrome and Opera. I used nasty custom HTML for the first version, but this could easily be converted to something valid. Feel free to mess around with it.
